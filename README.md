Laravel-Piwik
===============

An Interface to Piwik's Analytics API for Laravel (Composer Package)

This is the Laravel 4 version of the Laravel-Piwik Bundle.

I have not yet figured out tests, they will be done some time in the future, but not at the moment :)

Installation
============

Add `RobBrazier/Piwik` to `composer.json`:

```javascript
{
    "require": {
        "RobBrazier\Piwik": "2.0.*"
    }
}
```

Update your packages with `composer update` or install with `composer install`.
