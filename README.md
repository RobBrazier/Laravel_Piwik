Laravel-Piwik v2.0.0
====================

An Interface to Piwik's Analytics API for Laravel (Composer Package)

This is the Laravel 4 version of the Laravel-Piwik Bundle.

I have not yet figured out tests, they will be done some time in the future, but not at the moment :)

##Installation

Add `RobBrazier/Piwik` to `composer.json`:

```javascript
{
    "require": {
        "RobBrazier\Piwik": "2.0.*"
    }
}
```

Update your packages with `composer update` or install with `composer install`.

##Manual

The Manual is still the same as version 1.0.x, and is at [http://robbrazier.com/portfolio/laravel-piwik](http://robbrazier.com/portfolio/laravel-piwik).
